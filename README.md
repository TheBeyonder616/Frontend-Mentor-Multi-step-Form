## My Process

This project focuses on building a multi-step form that enhances user experience by guiding them through each step of the data collection process. The design is clean and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Utilized semantic elements for improved accessibility and SEO.

- **JavaScript:** Implemented dynamic interactions, form validation, and state management to enhance user engagement.

### Features

- **Multi-step Navigation:** Users can navigate through different steps of the form seamlessly.
- **Input Validation:** Real-time validation checks for user inputs to ensure correctness.
- **Progress Indicator:** Visual feedback on the current step in the form process.
- **Responsive Design:** The form is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
- **Submission Handling:** User inputs are collected and can be processed upon submission.

### JavaScript Functionality

The project includes multiple JavaScript files that handle core functionality. Key components include:

- **Form Management:** Handles navigation between steps and collects user inputs.
- **Validation:** Validates user inputs on each step to ensure data integrity.
- **Event Handling:** Manages user events such as button clicks and input changes.
- **State Management:** Maintains the state of user inputs across multiple steps.

### What I Learned
